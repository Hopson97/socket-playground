# Socket Playground

I am learning how to use sockets to connected two or more computer together, specifically for games. Here are just some random tests.

In order:
1. [TCP Chat](https://github.com/Hopson97/socket-playground/tree/master/tcp-chat)
    
This is a server-client chat app, was first time successfully using sockets.

2. [UDP Click Rects](https://github.com/Hopson97/socket-playground/tree/master/udp-rect-click)

You click to go to a new location, and it shows other players this as well.

3. [UDP Key Rects](https://github.com/Hopson97/socket-playground/tree/master/udp-rect-keys)

You press on the keyboard to move, and it shows this other players as well.
